@yihui, I love reading your articles, especially the Chinese articles, like: [16 小时骑行——我的天津绝望之旅](https://yihui.name/cn/2005/08/ride-to-tianjin-in-16-hours/). Yihui's words are always sharp. I feel some sad that it has been a very very long time since you last updated your blog for Chinese articles as a literary youth.
